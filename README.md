# Mitochondrial DNA in ALS 
# WGS vs Targeted seq

This repository contains the bash scripts for a comparison of the ability of WGS to replicate the variant calls of targeted sequencing in the study of the mitochondrial genomes of ALS patients.

It has been uploaded so that individuals marking the MSc thesis titled 'Whole genome sequences as a proxy for targeted 
sequencing in the study of mitochondrial genomes in ALS' can review the code behind the project. 

The MSc thesis was produced as part of MSc Genomic Medicine, delivered by St George's University of London, and King's College London. It was supervised by Dr Alfredo Iacoangeli.
